# RSA-2048-E3

This key uses a 2048-bit key with a public exponent, `e`, of 3.
Arguably this is not a "weak" key as keys with a public exponent of
3 are fairly easy to find in the wild. While it does offer security,
it is considered a poor practice. A more common value for the public
exponent is 65537.
